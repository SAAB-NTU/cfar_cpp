#Data
A copy is in the Desktop (Cannot easily upload via git)
5th and 12th Feb datasets --> Mosaicking/Mapping ==> Check CFAR quality with respect to original method
19th --> Parent Child Tracking  ==> Check CFAR speed here

#Analysis Folder
Oculus reader (Not the best solution, but a working one nonetheless) --> 
1) Convert Oculus V2 log file to V1 log file, then use the python script to extract the individual images
2) Height_map.ipynb --> Currently check what output do the extracted images give
 -- To include FLS position, which will improving mosaicking quality issues due to localization, (Abu Bakr)
 -- To include angled height estimation methods via trigonometry (Abu Bakr)
